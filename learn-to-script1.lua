Hello. If you are looking at this, this is a programming tutorial. If you are too lazy to read, take your tl;dr somewhere else, okay? Okay.
Anyway, we'll be going deeper and deeper into this scripting stuff. But for now, the basics.
On Roblox, we program in a language called Lua, specifically version 5.1. The admins mutated it(like everything else) into a language that interacts well with the parts in your game.
We'll start with a very basic command

print("Hello world!")

The print command outputs that line of text to the output window. Very useful to make sure something's working. And whenever you start a new language you MUST print 'hello world'.
